- How the Kernel Uses Drivers
Once a driver is loaded, it interacts with the kernel subsystems, such as the device driver subsystem (e.g., block devices, character devices, network devices). The kernel uses device trees, udev, and sysfs to interact with devices and load drivers dynamically based on hardware detection

1. What is a Kernel Driver?
A kernel driver is a piece of software that allows the kernel to interact with hardware devices. It abstracts the complexities of hardware and provides an interface for the rest of the operating system to communicate with the device. Drivers are typically implemented as kernel modules, which are loaded dynamically when needed.

2. Basic Structure of a Linux Driver
Drivers are loaded into the kernel and interact with the kernel's subsystems. A typical Linux driver consists of:

Initialization Function: Called when the driver is loaded.
Exit Function: Called when the driver is unloaded.
Device-Specific Functions: Functions to handle device operations like read, write, open, close, etc.
Key Functions in a Driver:
Module Initialization (module_init): This function is called when the module is loaded. It registers the driver with the kernel.
Module Exit (module_exit): This function is called when the module is unloaded. It unregisters the driver from the kernel.
3. Writing a Simple Kernel Module
Letâ€™s start with a basic "Hello, World!" module to get familiar with how drivers interact with the kernel.

modulo.c
Build the module:
make

Load the module:
sudo insmod hello.ko

Check the kernel log for the message:
dmesg | tail

Unload the module:
sudo rmmod hello

character_device_modulo.c
mknod /dev/simple_char_dev c <major_number> 0
echo "data" > /dev/simple_char_dev
cat /dev/simple_char_dev



- How the Kernel Uses Drivers
Once a driver is loaded, it interacts with the kernel subsystems, such as the device driver subsystem (e.g., block devices, character devices, network devices). The kernel uses device trees, udev, and sysfs to interact with devices and load drivers dynamically based on hardware detection
